<p>
  A Russian mutant, the character is a member of the X-Men, and he is by far the physically strongest member of the team, being able to transform into a strong metallic form. Even without his powers he holds a physically imposing figure standing at 6 ft 7 in (200 cm). Throughout the series, he has been portrayed as a quiet, honest, and innocent man. He has had a fairly consistent presence in X-Men-related comic books since his debut. A talented artist, he only reluctantly agrees to use his powers in combat, feeling that it is his responsibility to use his abilities for the betterment of human and mutant-kind.
