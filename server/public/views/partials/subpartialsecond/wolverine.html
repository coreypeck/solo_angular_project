  Born James Howlett and commonly known as Logan, Wolverine is a mutant who possesses animal-keen senses, enhanced physical capabilities, and powerful regenerative ability known as a healing factor. He has been depicted variously as a member of the X-Men, Alpha Flight, and the Avengers. The character first appeared in the last panel of The Incredible Hulk #180, with his first full appearance in #181. Wolverine then joined a revamped version of the superhero team the X-Men. Wolverine's catchphrase? "I'm the best there is at what I do, but what I do best isn't very nice".
