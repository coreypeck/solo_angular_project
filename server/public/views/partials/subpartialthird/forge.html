  A mutant with an unsurpassed brilliance in technology, Forge has had a lengthy career as a government weapons contractor. Created by writer Chris Claremont and artist John Romita Jr., Forge first appeared in Uncanny X-Men #184 (August 1984).

He shared a romantic relationship with Storm and a brief affair with Mystique, which led him to associate with the X-Men and thus enhancing the technology at the X-Mansion. He was also a member of the mutant group called X-Factor.
