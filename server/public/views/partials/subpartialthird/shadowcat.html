  Kitty Pryde possesses a "phasing" ability that allows her, as well as objects or people she is in contact with, to become intangible.[1] This power also disrupts any electrical field she passes through, and lets her simulate levitation. The youngest person to join the X-Men, Kitty received her first codename, Sprite, from Storm. Professor X also suggested the codename Ariel, which Kitty adopted for a short time prior to becoming Shadowcat. After joining the Guardians of the Galaxy, she replaced her fianc√©e and became part of the legend of the Star-Lord.
